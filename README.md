# 3D Scene Demo
This is a demo (or template/starting point, rather) for a 3D game. It comes with raylib and ReactPhysics3D installed locally, so all that's needed is to build and run.

Tested on macOS (TODO: Windows).

## Build and Run
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler, working in an IDE (such as CLion) helps with not only this but everything else. 
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. Create a build directory. 
4. `cd` into the buld directory and run `cmake ..`
5. After that, run `cmake --build . --target raylib_3d_example`
6. Then run, should all be good.

Let me know of any licensing issues that I've made here, I'm not a professinal and don't have "real-world" experience with this stuff.
